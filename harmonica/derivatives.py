    """
    Calculate the derivative of a potential field in the upward direction

    Compute the spatial derivative in the upward direction of regular gridded
    data using frequency domain calculations through Fast Fourier Transform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : :class:`xarray.DataArray`
        A two dimensional :class:`xarray.DataArray` whose coordinates are
        evenly spaced (regular grid). Its dimensions should be in the following
        order: *northing*, *easting*. Its coordinates should be defined in the
        same units.
    order : int
        The order of the derivative. Default to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : :class:`xarray.DataArray`
        A :class:`xarray.DataArray` with the upward derivatives of the passed
        ``grid``. Its units are the same units of the ``grid`` per units of its
        coordinates.
